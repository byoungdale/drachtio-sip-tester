# drachtio-sip-scenario-tester
A SIP scenario tester built on the drachtio framework using [drachtio-srf](https://github.com/davehorton/drachtio-srf) and [drachtio-fsmrf](https://github.com/davehorton/drachtio-fsmrf).  

### call functions

##### call.receive
  - receive a call

##### call.send
  - send a call

### in-call functions

##### incall.sendDTMF
  - send DTMF (callbacks currently not working for this function)

##### incall.playRecording
  - play recording(s) from endpoint

##### incall.modifyCall
  - hold or unhold (callbacks currently not working for this function)

##### incall.onReinvite
  - update SDP for re-invite

### endpoint registration

##### registrationHandler.register
  - register user
  
##### registrationHandler.unregister
  - unregister user (set with timeout on 200 response to register)

The magic happens in scenario.js where you place the in-call function in a async.series within the callback to call.receive or call.send. Take a look at the example scenario in /lib/scenario.js.

Note: In order to run this application, you must have the following:
* [drachtio-server](https://github.com/davehorton/drachtio-server) running locally and listening on port 8022
* freeswitch running locally, listening for event socket on port 8021, and configured as per [drachtio-fs-ansible](https://github.com/byoungdale/drachtio-fs-ansible)
